## General info & idea
v. 0.01 - currentyl only the folder- and file-structure

It should be a ToDo app to practice my knowledge. I want to create a class for the main app-functionality. The app should be responsive, organize tasks per drag n drop, add, delete and cancel tasks, if wanted show a history.
